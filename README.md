Directors Map of Power
======================

What?
-----

This is the development platform for the new version of the Directors Map of
Power website. It's a Symfony2 project.

The Directors Map of Power is the company appointment data held by Companies
House, in a linked, annotated, searchable form. Free for non-commercial use.
It is a list of the names of all company directors and secretaries in England,
Wales, and maybe some other places too.

Companies House let you retrieve a list of appointments for a specific
company, but we think it's important and helpful to be able to make the
reverse search: which companies are connected to a given person? This is
useful, for example, for checking the validity of the UK Parliament's Register
of Members' Interests. It's also a useful tool for investigative journalism,
and many other public interest exercises.
