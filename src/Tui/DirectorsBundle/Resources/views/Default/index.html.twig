<h2>Companies House Appointments Data</h2>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>What is this?</dt>
    <dd><p>This is the company appointment data held by Companies House, in a linked, annotated, searchable form. Free for non-commercial use. It is a list of the names of all company directors and secretaries in England, Wales, and maybe some other places too.</p>
    <p>Companies House let you retrieve a list of appointments for a specific company, but we think it's important and helpful to be able to make the reverse search: which companies are connected to a given person? This is useful, for example, for checking the validity of the UK Parliament's Register of Members' Interests. It's also a useful tool for investigative journalism, and many other public interest exercises.</p>
    </dd>
  
    <dt>Is this all the data?</dt>
    <dd><p>No. Companies House introduced the ability to provide a service address only a little while before we bought our initial dataset, and many (most?) entries still have residential addresses listed with their appointments. We don't feel that it's right to give out this information, although anyone may obtain it by applying for a report from Companies House itself.</p>
      <p>Companies that are currently active (not dissolved) are linked to <a href="http://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a>, who are A) lovely, and B) have richer information on companies than is available in our data files.</p>
    </dd>
  
    <dt>How up to date is it?</dt>
    <dd><p>This data is based on a snapshot taken on 4th March 2010. If we get another Â£4000, we'll buy it again. We welcome donations to this end - <a href="http://inanimatt.com/contact.php">get in touch</a>.</p></dd>
  
    <dt>Non-commercial?</dt>
    <dd><p>We strongly believe in projects like TheyWorkForYou.com, and want to support all efforts to bring greater accountability and transparency to government and big business. We think that opening this Companies House data will help. However, because we're not Companies House, it costs us money to acquire the data. If you wish to use this data for commercial gain, we ask that you pay for your access.</p></dd>
  
    <dt>Can I just have the original data files?</dt>
    <dd><p>Unfortunately the sales agreement we have signed with Companies House does not allow us to distribute the data files. We can, however, redistribute the content of them. Strange but true. Besides, we'd like to keep the data here so everyone can share the annotations.</p></dd>
  
    <dt>Why is everything in UPPER CASE?</dt>
    <dd><p>Sorry, that's the form we get it in.</p></dd>
  
    <dt>What are annotations?</dt>
    <dd><p>We're hoping to enrich the data by linking it to other places. If you know a particular company or person has, for example, a Wikipedia page, you can add it as an annotation. By linking our data to Wikipedia, TheyWorkForYou, etc, we can enrich both sites. </p></dd>
  
    <dt>Who are you?</dt>
    <dd><p>We're; Matt, Jake, Sam, Neil, Graeme, and Russ. We've worked on a number of projects that focus on the conjunction of business and politics, most notably <a href="http://whoknowswho.channel4.com/">a project</a> we pitched to Channel 4 in 2009 and subsequently <a href="http://whoknowswho.googlecode.com/">open-sourced</a>. We also worked on a UK release of <a href="http://littlesis.org/local/uk">LittleSis</a>.

  <h2>Other notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><p>This is an unstable, early release. More of a proof of concept, really. Expect more features, but also more disruption later.</p></li>
    <li><p>HTML, RDF and JSON outputs exist. Follow the links on each page, or change the URL extension to .rdf to get RDF output, and .json to get JSON output. You can also add a '&amp;callback=myFunc' parameter to return JSONP instead.</p></li>
    <li><p>Many thanks to <a href="http://www.nicecupoftea.org">Libby Miller</a> for the RDF output.</p></li>
