  <h2>What's this?</h2>
    <p>These are the names and connected companies of every company directory and secretary in the UK. Companies House will show you the directors of a specific company, but we think it's important and helpful to be able to make the reverse search: <strong>which companies are connected to a given person?</strong> This is useful, for example, for checking the validity of the UK Parliament's Register of Members' Interests. It's also a useful tool for investigative journalism, and many other public interest exercises.</p>
    <p>So we bought the data from Companies House and turned it loose in a linked, annotated, searchable form. Free for non-commercial use*.</p>
    <p>Soon we'll be inviting you to help add another big piece of missing data: <b>non-executive directors</b>. Everything you add will be published under an open database licence and be accessible through a simple API.</p>
    <small>* Unfortunately the Companies House data itself is Crown copyright for now, used under license.</small>
