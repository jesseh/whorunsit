<h2>FAQ</h2> 
 
  <dl> 
    <dt>What is this?</dt> 
    <dd><p>This is the company appointment data held by Companies House, in a linked, annotated, searchable form. Free for non-commercial use. It is a list of the names of all company directors and secretaries in England, Wales, and maybe some other places too.</p> 
    <p>Companies House let you retrieve a list of appointments for a specific company, but we think it's important and helpful to be able to make the reverse search: which companies are connected to a given person? This is useful, for example, for checking the validity of the UK Parliament's Register of Members' Interests. It's also a useful tool for investigative journalism, and many other public interest exercises.</p> 
    </dd> 
  
    <dt>Is this all the data?</dt> 
    <dd><p>No. Companies House introduced the ability to provide a service address only a little while before we bought our initial dataset, and many (most?) entries still have residential addresses listed with their appointments. We don't feel that it's right to give out this information, although anyone may obtain it by applying for a report from Companies House itself.</p> 
      <p>Companies that are currently active (not dissolved) are linked to <a href="http://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a>, who are A) lovely, and B) have richer information on companies than is available in our data files.</p> 
    </dd> 

    <dt>Will you remove my data?</dt>
    <dd><p>Sorry, no. The information is a public record, and we believe that the database as a whole constitutes a public good. Removing any more data than we currently show would undermine its benefit.</p>
    <p>It should also be noted that the information on this site is publicly available elsewhere. It would do no good to remove it from our site.</p></dd>
  
    <dt>How up to date is it?</dt> 
    <dd><p>This data is based on a snapshot taken in April 2011. If we get another Â£4000, we'll buy it again. We welcome donations to this end - please <a href="http://inanimatt.com/contact.php">get in touch</a>.</p></dd> 
  
    <dt>Non-commercial?</dt> 
    <dd><p>We strongly believe in projects like TheyWorkForYou.com, WhosLobbying.com, and OpenCorporates, and want to support all efforts to bring greater accountability and transparency to government and big business. We think that opening this Companies House data will help. However, because we're not Companies House, it costs us money to acquire the data. If you wish to use this data for commercial gain, we ask that you pay for your access so that we can continue to provide up to date information.</p></dd> 
  
    <dt>Can I just have the original data files?</dt> 
    <dd><p>Unfortunately the sales agreement we have signed with Companies House does not allow us to distribute the data files. We can, however, redistribute the full contents of them in a different format (strange but true, and believe me, you don't want them in the original format). Besides, we'd like to keep the data here so everyone can share the annotations.</p></dd> 
  
    <dt>What are annotations?</dt> 
    <dd><p>We're hoping to enrich the data by linking it to other places. If you know a particular company or person has, for example, a Wikipedia page, you can add it as an annotation. By linking our data to Wikipedia, TheyWorkForYou, etc, we can enrich both sites. </p></dd> 
  
    <dt>Who are you?</dt> 
    <dd><p>We're: Matt, Jake, Sam, Neil &amp; Graeme. We've worked on a number of projects that focus on the conjunction of business and politics, most notably <a href="http://whoknowswho.channel4.com/">a project</a> we pitched to Channel 4 in 2009 and subsequently <a href="http://whoknowswho.googlecode.com/">open-sourced</a>. We also worked on a UK release of <a href="http://littlesis.org/local/uk">LittleSis</a>.
