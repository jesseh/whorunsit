<h2>FAQ</h2> 
 
  <dl> 
    <dt id="what">What is this?</dt> 
    <dd><p>This is the company appointment data held by Companies House, in a linked, annotated, searchable form. Free for non-commercial use. It is a list of the names of all company directors and secretaries in England, Wales, and maybe some other places too.</p> 
    <p>Companies House let you retrieve a list of appointments for a specific company, but we think it's important and helpful to be able to make the reverse search: which companies are connected to a given person? This is useful, for example, for checking the validity of the UK Parliament's Register of Members' Interests. It's also a useful tool for investigative journalism, and many other public interest exercises.</p> 
    </dd> 
  
    <dt id="incomplete">Is this all the data?</dt> 
    <dd><p>No. Companies House introduced the ability to provide a service address only a little while before we bought our initial dataset, and many (most?) entries still have residential addresses listed with their appointments. We don't feel that it's right to give out this information, although anyone may obtain it by applying for a report from Companies House itself.</p> 
      <p>Companies that are currently active (not dissolved) are linked to <a href="http://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a>, who are A) lovely, and B) have richer information on companies than is available in our data files.</p> 
    </dd> 

    <dt id="out-of-date">My information's out of date!</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>We'd love to update your details! However Companies House currently charges between £3600 and £4000 for a snapshot of their data, so we can't afford to do it often. A daily feed costs roughly £50,000 a year. We can't update individual records either, for both resource and legal reasons. If your information is out of date, you should inform Companies House of any changes, and we'll pick them up the next time we obtain a snapshot from them.</p>
    </dd>


    <dt id="takedown">These are my personal details, I want them taken down!</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>We understand that you've got some privacy concerns, so we've done the following things to make sure your information won't be misused:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>We don't show full addresses or postcodes (even for service addresses) because a lot of the data we have is from before service addresses were introduced. Instead, we attempt to show only the town portion of the address. In some cases (where forms have been incorrectly filled out, or incorrectly entered by Companies House), a different line of the address might be shown. You need to contact Companies House if that's happened, not us. Bear in mind that our records lag behind theirs by several months, so it will take some time for the change show up in our database. We cannot edit your data.</li>
        <li>We don't show your full date of birth. Instead we show an age-bracket, or year of birth. This information is important for making accurate searches, so we don't hide it completely, but we know that some places like banks (very unwisely) use date of birth as a security check, even though it's very easy to discover. If this bothers you (and it should), complain to them.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>But we won't remove your data from our site. Here's why:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The information held on this site is a historical snapshot of the public record. Public record means the data <em>must</em> be made freely available to the public, and <em>anyone</em> is entitled to view it for (almost) any reason. Many companies make a business of providing this information to others. Removing it from our site won't remove it from theirs or from the public record, and won't make you any safer. You <em>have</em> to file these details with Companies House, and they <em>have</em> to make them available to the public. This is one of the mechanisms through which private companies are held accountable to the public.</li>

        <li>Please don't threaten us with the Data Protection Act. The Data Protection Act has an exemption for the information collected and distributed by Companies House. And regardless of whether <em>we</em> show your information, it will still be legally and publicly available elsewhere.</li>

        <li>Your full name, date of birth, directorships, home and service addresses, even company accounts are all available to private companies and individuals. Anyone can request these from Companies House and there are other public records too, like the electoral roll, the register of births and deaths, the land registry, etc.</li>

        <li>This is a public resource made up of public data. People have a right to know even if you'd rather they didn't; the information is already out there on other sites and company databases, available to anyone who asks. The only difference is that we don't charge for access. We think that you're better off knowing what other people can see about you, so you aren't under any illusions.</li>

      </ul>
    </dd>
    
    
    <dt id="atrisk">Are there <em>any</em> circumstances under which you'll remove data?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Yes. Companies House has a mechanism through which directors considered to be at risk can be removed from the official record. Anyone removed from the official record will also be removed whenever we update our data. Unfortunately we can't afford to do this often (so far it's been roughly once every 2 years). If your record has been removed from the Companies House records and (you can prove it to us), then we will of course also remove your record from our data set if you ask. Obviously Companies House don't provide a list of removed directors details (it defeats the point), so we cannot do this automatically.</p>
    </dd>
      
    <dt id="too-old">How up to date is it?</dt> 
    <dd><p>This data is based on a snapshot taken in April 2011. If we get another £4000, we'll buy it again. We welcome donations to this end - please <a href="http://inanimatt.com/contact.php">get in touch</a>.</p></dd> 
  
    <dt id="commercial">Non-commercial?</dt> 
    <dd><p>We strongly believe in projects like TheyWorkForYou.com, WhosLobbying.com, and OpenCorporates, and want to support all efforts to bring greater accountability and transparency to government and big business. We think that opening this Companies House data will help. However because we're not Companies House, it costs us money to acquire the data. If your company uses our site in any of its processes, we ask that you pay for your access so that we can continue to provide up to date information.</p></dd> 
  
    <dt id="data">Can I just have the original data files?</dt> 
    <dd><p>Unfortunately the sales agreement we have signed with Companies House does not allow us to distribute the data files. We can, however, redistribute the full contents of them in a different format (strange but true, and anyway believe me, you don't want them in the original format). Besides, we'd like to keep the data here so everyone can share the annotations.</p></dd> 
  
    <dt id="who">Who are you?</dt> 
    <dd><p>We're: Matt, Jake, Sam, Neil &amp; Graeme. We've worked on a number of projects that focus on the conjunction of business and politics, most notably <a href="http://whoknowswho.channel4.com/">a project</a> we pitched to Channel 4 in 2009 and subsequently <a href="http://whoknowswho.googlecode.com/">open-sourced</a>. We also worked on a UK release of <a href="http://littlesis.org/local/uk">LittleSis</a>.
