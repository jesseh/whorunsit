<h2>About WhoRunsIt</h2>
  <p>Companies House will show you the directors of a specific company, but we think it's important and helpful to be able to make the reverse search: <strong>which companies are connected to a given person?</strong> This is useful, for example, for checking the validity of the UK Parliament's Register of Members' Interests. It's also a useful tool for investigative journalism, and many other public interest exercises.</p>
  <p>So we bought the data from Companies House and turned it loose in a linked, annotated, searchable form. Free for non-commercial use.</p>
  <p>The site itself is open-source under an MIT-like license. You're welcome to participate in running and developing the site - you can <a href="https://github.com/tuimedia/whorunsit">find the source-code on GitHub</a>. We'd be delighted to take on pull-requests.</p>

<h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We're; Matt, Jake, Sam, Neil, Graeme, and Russ. We've worked on a number of projects that focus on the conjunction of business and politics, most notably <a href="http://whoknowswho.channel4.com/">a project</a> we pitched to Channel 4 in 2009 and subsequently <a href="http://whoknowswho.googlecode.com/">open-sourced</a>. We also worked on a UK release of <a href="http://littlesis.org/local/uk">LittleSis</a>.
