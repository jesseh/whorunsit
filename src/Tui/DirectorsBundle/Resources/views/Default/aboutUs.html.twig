<h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We're; Matt, Jake, Sam, Neil, Graeme, and Russ. We've worked on a number of projects that focus on the conjunction of business and politics, most notably <a href="http://whoknowswho.channel4.com/">a project</a> we pitched to Channel 4 in 2009 and subsequently <a href="http://whoknowswho.googlecode.com/">open-sourced</a>. We also worked on a UK release of <a href="http://littlesis.org/local/uk">LittleSis</a>.
